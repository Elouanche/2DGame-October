## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project was to get familiar with **Unity**. After working with **Unreal Engine** and its Blueprint system, we wanted to explore a more hands-on and accessible environment supported by an active community.

### Main objectives:
- Develop a playable **2D platformer level** with a **main menu**.
- Implement a **character controller** with movement, jumping, death, and respawn at checkpoints.
- Integrate a **health bar** and a **death screen** to enhance the gameplay experience.

## 2. Development Framework

- **Education Level**: Second-year **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science**.
- **Project Duration**: 1 month.
- **Main Goal**: Build a functional **2D platformer level** with core gameplay mechanics.
- **Implemented Features**:
  - Character movement and jumping in a 2D environment.
  - Character death and respawn system.
  - Death screen and health bar mechanics.

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Game Engine**: Unity (version **2022.3.39f1**)

## 4. Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elouanche/2DGame-October.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **Unity** (**version 2022.3.39f1**).
3. Build and run the game within Unity to launch the level.

## 5. Usage

Once the project is running, the game starts with the **main menu**. The default controls are:

- **Move**: Arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
- **Jump**: Spacebar

## 6. Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements to enhance the game:

- **Add enemies (AI-controlled mobs)** to increase challenge.
- **Introduce multiple levels and scenarios** for a more immersive experience.
- **Optimize the health bar** with animations and visual effects.
- **Enhance level design** with obstacles and interactive elements.
